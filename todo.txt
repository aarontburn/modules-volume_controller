1. Prevent master slider from changing if user clicks in element range but not on slider
    - Sandwich slider with two divs

2. Add a "lock" button to each session to prevent the session from being muted.
    - Use case: when the user solo's and unsolos, all tracks, even if they were previously muted,
        become unmuted

3. Sorting options (PID, name, etc.)
4. Process alias
    - Store conversion, and when process name equals key, change name to the converted
        ex. R5apex -> Apex Legends
        
5. Presets
    - Save Presets
    - Manage Presets (delete)
